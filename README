This package has been through a few maintainers over the years.

It was originally written by Dan Perry, and available from
<http://www.pppl.gov/~dperry/>

Then, it was downloaded from there and debianized by Brian Elliott
Finley in Mar 2006.

Then, Doug Engbert made a number of changes to it during 2009.

Then, in Feb 2010, James Knight then downloaded the debian package with
changes from <http://download.systemimager.org/~finley/msktutil/>, and
made even more changes. That's what you have now. :)

In Feb 2012, Ken Dreyer provided some build fixes.

In 2012 and 2013, Mark Proehl, Michael Weiser and Olaf Flebbe provided
enhancements and build fixes
