This package has been through a few maintainers over the years.

It was originally written by Dan Perry, and available from
<http://www.pppl.gov/~dperry/>

Then, it was downloaded from there and debianized by Brian Elliott
Finley in Mar 2006.

Then, Doug Engbert made a number of changes to it during 2009.

Then, in Feb 2010, James Knight then downloaded the debian package with
changes from <http://download.systemimager.org/~finley/msktutil/>, and
made even more changes. That's what you have now. :)

In Feb 2012, Ken Dreyer provided some build fixes.

In 2012 and 2013, Mark Proehl, Michael Weiser and Olaf Flebbe provided
enhancements and build fixes

In 2017 Michael Osipov joined the team
