Some Thoughts about Salting in Active Directory...
===============================================================================

Windows uses

  realm_name+"host"+samAccountName_nodollar+"."+lower_realm_name

for the salt of machine accounts.

(Note: samaccountname_nodollar is lower case for machine accounts)

(Note: only for DES/AES; arcfour-hmac-md5 doesn't use salts at all)

Salt for service accounts is created in a different way:

- if userPrincpalName is not set:

  realm_name+samAccountName

  (Note: samAccountName is case sensitive for service accounts)

- if userPrincpalName is set:

  realm_name + first component from userPrincpalName

(Windows 2000 may have used something different, but who cares...)

FIXME: this is stupid, and not future proof. The salt is supposed to
be an implementation detail that the server can set to whatever it
feels like (so long as it doesn't change it except when the password
changes). A future version of Windows may change the salting algorithm
to something else, or may even start using random salts.

In the normal authentication path, the client asks the KDC what salt
to use when encrypting the password for the account, and then uses
that. And for the creation of a keytab in MIT Kerberos (in the suual
case), you use the kadmin protocol to download the already salted key
block.

But, here, we need to take a password and encrypt it the same way the
server is going to, in order to store it in the keytab. All we need is
to ask the server what salt it wants to use...But, as far as I can
tell, there exists no API in libkrb5 that can retrieve the salt that
should be used with a given principal, even though it's clearly
available in the network protocol.

Note: even if the salting string could be fetched from the network
protocol, that would only be possible after the password has been set
in AD.  But the keytab entry should be created before that.

What we're doing here is very much like MIT Kerberos' ktutil addent
-password, which also assumes the server uses a particular salt. And
that is also broken. Given this email thread:
<http://mailman.mit.edu/pipermail/krbdev/2009-July/007835.html>, I
hope libkrb5 will provide the proper API before MS switches to start
using randomized salts in some future AD release.
